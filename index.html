    <p> More than 500 anxious shoppers waited patiently in line on Bayshore Shopping Centre’s ground floor to be among the first to shop at Victoria’s Secret Tuesday night, before the store’s official opening Wednesday at 9 a.m.

With more than 13,000 square feet or bras, panties, lingerie, loungewear and their now-iconic wings, the store had not trouble whatsoever living up to its reputation as a sexy fantasyland for women, and men, though strangely, very few men made it to the opening gala.</p>
